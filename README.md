# con4XD

This is the code for the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8392NJjj8s0

There is also a 2nd video that includes an AI version that might be helpful: https://youtu.be/8392NJjj8s0?si=9tT9Itp7-PbWoK-n

Modifications I made from the 1st tutorial for con4XD (aka connect 4 exploding disc):
1. Changed game board design/layout
2. Added "Player X" turn labels
3. Added V1 of the "bomb/exploding disc" functionality (the bomb disc and turn rules) - I think it's working pretty well
4. There was something else, but I've hardly had any sleep, so I don't remember :) 

I wasn't sure which way we wanted to go here, so I made 2 bomb versions:
con4XDv1 - bomb removes pieces left, right, and directly below
con4XDv2 - bomb removes pieces left, right, diagonal right, diagonal left, and directly below
